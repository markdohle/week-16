MIT xPro Week 16 - Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React

In Module 16: Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React, youâ€™ll manage state across parent and child components. You'll also work through the component lifecycle, by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

You'll apply these concepts in the creation of another game (of your choosing) in React, which you can share with your peers in the Parent And Child Components In A Game discussion. You will also have an opportunity to share your improvements to the Tic-Tac-Toe game with your peers at the end of the module. Be sure to contribute your code to a GitHub repository as you code along with the videos.
